# QR Code Generator

This repository contains a first try of building an application in pure PHP wich generates multi-URLs QR Codes. It is capable of generating a "conditional" QR Code, wich is going to take
the user to different URLs depending on it OS.


## Motivation

The main application of this feature is on Digital Marketing. It can clean up your website, wich will not need two QR Codes anymore (one for Android users, wich redirect to Play Store, and one for IOS users, wich redirect to App Store),
but only one elegant and customized QR Code.
